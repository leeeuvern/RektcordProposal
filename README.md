<h1>Our Plan</h1>  
<p>
      Think LinkedIn, but a Web3 platform that gives due respect to scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is to create a shareable profile page linked to an ETH address. The profile page will showcase all the user's achievements, including NFT badges minted and distributed by us through integration with the Web2 leaderboard APIs of Ronin Games. "GM manager" will now be backed with proof of skill and achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrating with Web2 APIs is the foundational idea, but it can be further developed. Personally, I have vast experience in reverse engineering game leaderboard APIs to obtain data and create tools from it. Generally, Web3 games are more than happy for you to do this (although it involves reverse engineering), as the tools created complement the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have implemented this for Polygon games such as MetaSoccer and DerbyStars, as well as Ronin Games like Axie Infinity and WildForest. Obtaining data and integrating it will not be an issue. But I guess the main challenge is to create a user-friendly interface and integration process that can be used by the masses. Ronin ecosystem funds will be used to hire extra developer and designers. Being lean and efficient is the way I work personally.
    </p>
    <p>
     Further vision -  It is my hope that scholarship for games is not the be-all and end-all of a scholar's journey. Yes, many scholars need this for their daily sustenance, but I also hope they can develop their hard skills, such as coding, graphic design, and more. This can be part two of our vision, where we incentivize educational learning and reward completed learning with NFT badges to verify that they have indeed qualified for these skills. All of this is displayed on a single page: your "Rektcord" (Rekt + record).
